# Numerical Methods
### Description
This repository contains implementations of different numerical methods for solving ordinary differential equations (ODEs) in Python. The methods include:
- **Euler's Method**
- **Runge-Kutta Method (RK4)**
- **Taylor Method**

### Files
#### 1. EulerMethod.py
Euler's method is a simple numerical technique for solving ODEs. This script implements the method to approximate the solution to an initial value problem.

#### 2. RungeKuttaMethod.py
This script implements the 4th-order Runge-Kutta method (RK4) for solving ODEs. RK4 provides a higher accuracy compared to Euler's method.

#### 3. TaylorMethod.py
The Taylor method is used to approximate the solution of ODEs using a Taylor series expansion. This script implements the second-order Taylor method for solving an ODE.

Prerequisites
To run these scripts, you need to have the following Python packages installed:

`matplotlib` for plotting graphs
`numpy` for numerical calculations (only for RK4 method)
